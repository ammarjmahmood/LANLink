## 🔧 How It Works

LanLink uses a powerful yet simple technology stack:

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript create a responsive and interactive UI
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express provides a lightweight and efficient server
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO enables instant message delivery and status updates
- **Network Discovery**: Automatic IP detection makes sharing the app with others effortless

When you start the server, it automatically identifies your local IP address and creates a URL that anyone on your network can access. Each user chooses a username, and the server manages all connections, message distribution, and status updates.

## 📱 User Experience

![Dark Mode](darkmode-mobile.png)

The app opens with a stylish welcome animation before prompting users to choose a username. Once connected, users can:

- Send and receive messages in real time
- See when others are typing
- Toggle between light and dark themes
- View who's currently online
- Receive notifications for new messages and user activity

## 🛠️ Technical Details

NexusChat's architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Client-side Application**: Handles UI rendering, user interactions, and Socket.IO client connections
2. **Express Server**: Serves static files and manages HTTP connections
3. **Socket.IO Server**: Manages WebSocket connections for real-time communication

The application uses event-driven programming to handle user actions and server responses, creating a smooth and responsive experience.
